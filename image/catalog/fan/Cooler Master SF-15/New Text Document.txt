Overview

In order to protect a gamer’s gear while it’s under heavy stress from game play, the SF-17 and SF-15 employ their incredible ability to dissipate excess heat through their perforated surface. SF-17 and SF-15 also have a strengthened mesh that can withstand all laptop sizes up to 19” and 15.6” respectively. Each features a single, large, and adjustable turbine fan (SF-15 is 160mm, SF-17 is 180mm) that is specially engineered to provide unprecedented airflow that keeps laptop components running at optimal temperatures.
